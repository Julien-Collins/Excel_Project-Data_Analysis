# My Excel Data Analytics Projects

Greetings! This project details my analysis of jobs within the data industry.

## Project 1: Salary Dashboard

This dashboard synthesizes salary data for data-related jobs across various countries and positions. Using a dataset of real-world data science job information from 2023, it provides insights into salary trends based on job titles, locations, and other relevant factors. The goal is to offer a clear and actionable overview of the current job market for data professionals.

- Filtering by checking job title, country, schedule type, and excluding blank salaries.
- Array Formula created utilizing MEDIAN() function with nested IF() statement to analyze an array.
- This formula populates a table and returns the median salary based on job title, country, and type.

### Data Validation: 

- Implementing the filtered list as a data validation rule to ensure:
- User input is retricted to validated schedule types
- Incorrect entries are presented
- Overall usabilitiy of the dashboard is enhanced


  ## Conclusion:

This project analyzes job market data to calculate the median salary for specific job titles, countries, and schedules. By filtering out zero salaries and applying multiple conditions (job title, country, and schedule type), it provides a precise, condition-based salary analysis. The goal is to offer actionable insights into salary trends across different job categories, helping professionals and organizations make informed decisions.
